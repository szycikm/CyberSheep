# CyberSheep
Final project for Objective Programming class, second semester on Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology
# NFOs
For the third time in this semester I start a virtual world project, this time in Typhon. It's the last time I swear! :D

Again, please note this is my first Python project, so I have no idea what I'm doing.
# Observations
Observations:
It's funny how in every iteration of this project I had less and less to care about. It went like this:
<ul>
<li>cpp - do your programming</li>
<li>java - don't care about memory</li>
<li>python - only care about indents</li>
</ul>
I had little problems learning python. The syntax is clean and logical; some of the requirements seem silly, like character limit for line, but that really makes you write with style. Some things annoyed me, like writing "self" everywhere or lack of normal for and switch. The real problems started when I wanted to add a GUI. There's like a gazillion libraries for GUI and trying them out was a painful process. I just couldn't install many of them because... reasons? The ones I managed to install depended on some other libraries that I couldn't install. Huh. Finally I found the "standard" python gui library - tkinter. Of course I couldn't install it at first and had to reinstall python. FINALLY I managed to display a small window with a single label that read "well, that didn't work". Unlike java and windows forms, here I didn't have any fancy window creator thing - I had to manually write everything. But it was no problem, thanks to this guy's tutorials https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBwibXFtPtflztSNPGuIB_d. 

Overall, I think I learned quite a few things by working on this project(s). I did my first steps in java and python and saw differences between them (and c++). I also think I'm finally getting the hang of events, thanks to my struggles with tkinter. I know I didn't do everything perfect, for example I probably should add more try-catches, but I'm still happy with how it turned out. Now that's finished, maybe I can finally get to my personal projects.
